// src/modules/invoices/billed.test.ts
// Unit tests for the ONE rule behind previouslyBilled / billedToDate
// (architecture invariant 6), feature 05 Check When Done:
//   - "previouslyBilled excludes draft/cancelled/revised"
//   - "revision exclusion" — a REVISED invoice never counts (its replacement
//     does), so a revision can never double-bill the same work.
