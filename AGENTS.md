# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Application Building Context

Read the following files in order before implementing or making any architectural decision:

1. `context/product-context.md` — the why: problem, users, success metrics, non goals
2. `context/project-overview.md` — the what: product definition, goals, features, and scope
3. `context/architecture-context.md` — system structure, boundaries, storage model, and invariants
4. `context/architecture-standards.md` — architecture style, module boundaries, when to split
5. `context/security-standards.md` — auth, authorization, validation, secrets, compliance
6. `context/error-handling.md` — error contract, logging, observability
7. `context/testing-standards.md` — test pyramid, what is tested first, definition of done
8. `context/data-model.md` — canonical entities, indexes, migration rules
9. `context/ui-context.md` — theme, colors, typography, canvas design, and component conventions
10. `context/code-standards.md` — implementation rules and conventions
11. `context/ai-workflow-rules.md` — development workflow, scoping rules, and delivery approach
12. `context/progress-tracker.md` — current phase, completed work, open questions, and next steps

Update `context/progress-tracker.md` after each meaningful implementation change. The feature spec's `## Progress Tracker` section names the exact fields to touch.

## Working In One Feature Per Chat

This project is built one feature at a time, one chat at a time. That is deliberate.

- **One feature spec per chat.** Never two. If a change spans two features, split it, or open a second chat.
- **Start a chat** by naming the feature spec file, or running `/selcy <feature>`. The builder reads this file first, then the context files above, then that one spec.
- **End a chat** by updating `context/progress-tracker.md` per the spec's `## Progress Tracker` section. If it is not written there, the next chat does not know it happened.
- **A mistake in one chat must not touch another feature.** That is the whole point of the split. If a fix turns out to cross a boundary, stop and say so instead of editing the other feature's scope.

## Standards Are Contracts, Not Suggestions

The standards files (architecture, security, error handling, testing, data model) are inherited by every feature spec. A feature may add to them but never relax them. If a spec contradicts a standards file, the standards file wins.

## Context Files Are The Spec

Context files define what to build, how to build it, and what the current state of progress is. Always implement against them. Do not infer or invent behavior from scratch.

## Stack Snapshot (quick orientation)

- **Next.js App Router + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + shadcn/ui**
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL 16**, **Better Auth** (username/email, no public registration)
- **decimal.js** untuk uang, **Vitest + Playwright** untuk test
- **pdf-service terpisah** (Playwright Chromium, signed internal request)
- **Docker Compose** (app + postgres + pdf-service), deploy target **Coolify**, auto-deploy on push main
- UI Bahasa Indonesia, locale `id-ID`, timezone `Asia/Jakarta` (DB UTC)
- Repo: https://github.com/maulanaadib/invoice-me (branch `main`)

## Non Negotiables (master prompt)

- **Tidak ada tombol palsu, halaman dummy, data statis yang menyamar sebagai fitur, TODO, atau fungsi yang belum bekerja.**
- Semua aksi yang membaca/mengubah data organization wajib lewat autentikasi + otorisasi server-side.
- Validasi input di server, bukan hanya browser.
- Semua kalkulasi uang dihitung ulang server-side; tidak percaya total dari client.
- Invoice issued tidak bisa diedit diam-diam; snapshot immutability.
- Hasil akhir harus terasa seperti aplikasi bisnis sungguhan, bukan demo AI.
